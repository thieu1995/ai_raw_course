    "- loading an unlabelled dataset in python\n",
    "- creating 'Data Visualisations' --such as 2D and 3D scatter plots with different colourings to examine the relationships between the values of different features\n",
    "     in your data set\n",

    "Like models these implement a 'fit()' method,  but instead of `predict()' they have a 'transform()' method. \n",
    "\n",

    "Assuming as usual  we store our set of examples as rows in an array X, with a  column for each features.  \n",
    "For each individual feature j (column in X) it: \n",
    "- finds the highest  and lowest  values in column j of X\n",
    "- uses these to calculate  the *range* of values in the column range(X[,j]) = max(X[,j] - min(X[,j])  \n",
    "- subtracts the min(X[,j]) from each value so that they now all start from 0 and the highest value is now max(X[,j] - min(X[,j])\n",
    "- divide each value by the range(X[,j]) so the upper value  is now 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're feeling confident about numpy arrays and data slicing you could try implementing this your self using a loop over each column (X.shape[1]) and doing slicing making calls to numpy's min(), max() functions.  \n",
