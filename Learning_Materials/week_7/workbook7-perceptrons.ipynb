    "# Perceptrons - The basis of Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptrons, invented by Frank Rosenblatt in the late 1950's,\n",
    "are a form of supervised machine learning algorithm inspired by neuron cells.\n",
    "In neurons, signals come in along the dendrites and out along the axon. \n",
    "A synapse is the connection between the axon of one cell and the dendrites of another.\n",
    "Crudely, input signals are 'summed' and if they reach a certain threshold the neuron 'fires'\n",
    "and sends a signal down the synapse to the connected cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Perceptron](figures/Perceptron.png \"Perceptron Image\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptrons are an algorithmic approximation of this process and can learn to solve simple classification problems.\n",
    "Input values are multiplied by a learnable parameter called a *weight*.\n",
    "If the sum of the inputs $\\times$ weights is over a certain threshold the Perceptron 'fires' and generates an output.\n",
    "We use the *error* in the output to change the value of the *weights* by a small amount - the *learning rate*.\n",
    "The process is repeated until the error is 0, or as small as we can get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The threshold which determines if the Perceptron produces an output is determined by its *activation function*.\n",
    "For Perceptrons this is often a step function which outputs a 1 or 0 i.e. 'fires' or not. However, it can also be a\n",
    "non-linear function such as sigmoid, which will always produce a real numbered output in the range 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perceptron - Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set weights to random values in range [-0.5, 0.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set learning rate to a small value, usually less than 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each training example in the dataset i.e one 'epoch'\n",
    "\n",
    "    A. Calculate output (activation)\n",

    "    B. Calculate error\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $error = target \\, output - activation$\n",
    "\n",
    "    C. Update each of the weights values\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $change \\, in \\, weight = error \\times input \\times learning \\, rate$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat from step 3 until error is 0 (or as close as possible), or for the number of training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perceptrons - Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use binary data to show that Perceptrons can learn to represent logical functions,\n",
    "though you could also think about it as a prediction/classification problem\n",
    "i.e. for a given set of inputs what is the correct output.\n",
    "A truth table can be used as the Perceptrons *training* data, with each row representing an input example.\n",
    "Each training example has two inputs (*features*) and one output (*label*).\n",
