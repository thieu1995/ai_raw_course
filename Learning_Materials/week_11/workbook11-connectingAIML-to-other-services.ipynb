    "\n",
    "The first activity is designed  to give you practical experience of:\n",
    "- setting bot predicates outside your bot,  to customize it\n",
    "- using `<system>` tag-pairs to make calls and connecting your chatbot to external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second activity gives you a chance to work on the first bit of coursework, and make sure your testing toolchain is in place.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Understood how external programmes can affect your bot,  and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
