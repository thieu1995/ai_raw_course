    "# Artificial Intelligence 1 Week 9 Practical\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. The aim of this session is to give you practical experience of creating a  knowledge base for an expert system with some simple forward chaining.\n",
    "2. To do that you will author a simple chat-bot using the AIML knowledge representation language. \n",
    "3. To aid your learning, your chat-bot should hold answers to 12 questions about knowledge based systems these in the form of a 'FAQ'\n",
    "  - This 12 form the basis of the knowledge base you will author for the final part of the assessed portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "- Understood how preprocessing is applied to text before it reaches the AIML interpreter.\n",
    "- Coded up a knowledge base for a chatbot to answer 12 questions about knowledg-based systems.\n",
    "- Successfully used  &lt;srai&gt; tag-pairs in AIML to do some simple forward chaining for different greetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Expanded your chatbot using &lt;srai&gt; tag-pairs storing knowledge about language,   \n",
    "  so that your bot can respond to different ways of asking the same question\n",
    "- Expanded the domain-specific knowledge contents of your bots with categories for all the other key concepts covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources\n",
    "Good places to look for help with AIML syntax are: \n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML-Fundaments](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-fundamentals)\n",
    " - [Pandorabots AIML reference - for syntax](https://www.pandorabots.com/docs/aiml-reference/)\n",
