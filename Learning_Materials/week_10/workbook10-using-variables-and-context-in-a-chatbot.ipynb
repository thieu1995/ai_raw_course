    "The second activity gives you a chance to see the specification for the first bit of coursework: the questions your bot has to answer and the marking scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this session you should have\n",
    "- Successfully used the AIML constructs `*` `_`, `<srai>`, and `<star/>` tags to make general statements about language (how people ask questions).\n",
    "- Successfully used `<that>` tags to give let your bot respond in the context of a dialogue.\n",
    "- Understood what you need to do for the first piece of coursework.\n",
    "- Downloaded and run the marking programme to check you can test your knowledge-base before submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before next week you should have\n",
    "- Expanded your  chatbot so it can the same question asked in different ways about each of the facts you have stored.   \n",
    "- Got your chatbot to correctly answer a question in different ways according what the previous question was.\n",
    "- **Made sure you know what the final part of the portfolio is and how to use the practice marking notebook**\n",
